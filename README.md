# MK Mem Manage
## Description
This is a library of memory management techniques written in C99, beginning with an arena allocator and object pool macros (as a header only library)
## Warnings
 - This is a pet project which deals with different techniques for manual memory management
 - I am a student so there will likely be many mistakes and this is created solely as a learning experience 
     - unless your suggestions provide a learning opportunity I will likely not listen
 - I can make no guarantees for the safety of this library, especially in its current state
